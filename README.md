# Data Structures and Algorithms

Here, as I keep solving problems, I will keep pushing the code so that I can
keep track of what questions I have done and how consistent I have been.

Topics To Do:

1. Trees
2. Graphs
3. Queue
4. Stack
5. Problems based on Arrays
6. Problems based on Strings
7. Linked Lists
8. Searching Algorithms
9. Sorting Algorithms
