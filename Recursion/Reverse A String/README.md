# Reverse A String using Recursion

The idea behind it is to keep recursively iterating or making function calls on each
element of a string until you reach null character '\0'. At that point you start printing
character from last to first one by one. 

It is as they say, A Very Elegant way to solve reverse a string problem but because we 
are using recursion, space complexity will most likely be high.
